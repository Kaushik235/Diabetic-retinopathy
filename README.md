In this project,we worked in predicting if the iris of a human has diabetic retinopathy or not.Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Poorly controlled blood sugar is a risk factor.
Early symptoms include floaters, blurriness, dark areas of vision and difficulty perceiving colors. Blindness can occur.So we used Kaggle dataset and we did some image processing using CLAHE algorithm and then we utilized mobilenet to train our model and we did hyperparameter tuning using grass hopper optimizer
